# Detection-of-ships-using-satellite-imagery
Imagery provides unique insights into various markets, including agriculture, defense and intelligence, energy, and finance. New commercial imagery providers, such as planets, are using constellations of small satellites to capture images of the entire Earth every day. This flood of new imagery is outgrowing the ability for organizations to manually look at each image that gets captured, and there is a need for machine learning and computer vision algorithms to help automate the analysis process. The aim of this dataset is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of large ships in satellite images. The open-source dataset of the planet ship is used to test the results of the proposed scheme, containing preprocessed 4000 images. In terms of automatic detection of small ship targets, the proposed algorithm performs well. Its advantages are manifold: it is simple and robust, but most of all, it is efficient and fast, which is a crucial point in the performance evaluation of advanced ship detection strategies.
